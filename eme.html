          Catra is one of the main characters in "She-Ra and the Princesses of
          Power". She is the former secondary antagonist. Starting out as a
          cadet in the Horde, Catra was soon promoted to the rank of Force
          Captain and eventually served as Hordak's second in command. After the
          invasion of the Galactic Horde, Catra briefly served as an agent of
          Horde Prime.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was raised by the dark sorceress Shadow Weaver along side her best
          friend Adora. Shadow Weaver was a cruel and unforgiving mother figure,
          who would often times chastise, taunt, and mock her in front of Adora.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Adora left the Horde to defect to the Rebellion, Catra tried to
          bring Adora back to the Fright Zone - convinced that she was just
          confused and going through a ‘phase’.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Catra slowly began to realize that Adora's absence opened the
          opportunity to step out from her friend’s shadow for the first time in
          her life - and she began to allow the anger she felt after Adora left
          to fuel her ambition with the Horde.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, she casts aside her friendship in favor of her newfound
          strength and achievements, basking in the glory she has attained
          without Adora's aid. However,Catra's rage, anger, and sadness began to
          weigh heavily on her despite achieving multiple military victories
          over the Princess Alliance and thanks to the psychoanalysis of the
          treacherous Double Trouble, she became dejected with herself and
          confronted her own inner struggles and question her motivations.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Fifth Season, Catra finally accepts that the choices she made
          and the people that she hurt had destroyed her, and that her ruthless
          ambition was just hiding the pain she felt in wanting to be accepted
          by others. She redeems herself, renews her friendship with Adora,
          fights for the Rebellion and joins The Best Friends Squad.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the series finale,
          <strong class="strong"
            >she confesses her love to Adora and becomes her girlfriend.</strong
          >
          Catra is said by the creators to be 17-18 years old.
